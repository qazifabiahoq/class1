Here are 3 conclusions that can be drawn from the crowdfunding campaign analysis:

Theatre Campaigns: The data indicates that "theatre" crowdfunding campaigns show distinct characteristics. They experience both higher success rates (187 out of 200), higher rates of failure (132 out of 140), and more cancellations (23 out of 25) compared to other categories in most countries. However, it's essential to note that "theatre" campaigns are less likely to be currently "live" when compared to categories like "film & video" and "games." Further analysis of subcategories reveals that "play" campaigns within the "theatre" category exhibit more successful, failed, and canceled campaigns. This suggests that "theatre" campaigns are efficient in meeting their goals and receiving pledged funds, even though the number of campaigns might not be the highest.

Film & Video Campaigns: The analysis shows that the "film & video" category has the highest number of live crowdfunding campaigns, especially in countries like the United States, Great Britain, and Australia. Subcategories within "film & video," such as animation, documentary, drama, and shorts, contribute to its prominence. "Film & video" maintains a higher number of live campaigns, particularly in regions with higher population density.

Seasonal Trends: The time series chart indicates a recurring trend of reduced campaign success from July to September during the years 2010 to 2020. This decline is associated with a higher number of failed and canceled campaigns during these summer months. The drop in the number of live campaigns during the same period contributes to the decrease in successful campaigns. Several factors, such as summer activities and the back-to-school season, may explain this trend. However, it's important to note that there are more successful campaigns than failed, live, and canceled campaigns, and creators generally avoid cancellations due to the loss of funds.

Regarding the limitations of the dataset:

Limited Sampling: The dataset includes a small number of countries and regions, which limits the generalizability of the conclusions. Including more countries could provide a more comprehensive view of crowdfunding outcomes.

Currency Variability: Campaigns in different currencies pose challenges for financial analysis. Converting various currencies to a common currency is necessary for accurate comparisons.

Niche Categories: The dataset does not cover all possible campaign types within categories, limiting the scope of analysis. Including additional niche categories and subcategories would enhance the analysis.

Platform Ambiguity: The dataset does not specify whether campaigns are from Kickstarter or Indiegogo. Each platform has unique dynamics, and this information would help analyze the data accurately.

Outliers: High outlier campaigns with exceptionally high pledges can affect statistical analysis. Addressing outliers is essential for accurate insights.

Additional graphs and tables that could be created for further analysis:

Average Donation by Country: A bar chart to compare average donation amounts across different countries, providing insights into geographic backer behavior.

Goal vs. Pledged Scatterplot: A scatterplot to explore the relationship between campaign funding goals and pledged amounts, identifying trends and outliers.

Time to Reach Goal Histogram: A histogram to visualize the time taken to reach campaign goals, considering "Date Created Conversion" and "Date Ended Conversion."

Staff Picked Impact Pie Chart: A pie chart to understand the success rate of staff-picked campaigns vs. non-staff-picked campaigns.

Currency Conversion Rate Time Series Chart: A time series chart to analyze currency conversion rates over time and their impact on campaign outcomes.

Backer Engagement Time Series Chart: A time series chart to analyze the number of backers over the campaign duration for successful, live, and failed campaigns.

Average Pledged Amount by Outcome Pivot Table/Bar Chart: A pivot table or bar chart to calculate and analyze the average pledged amount for different campaign outcomes.

Regarding the use of median vs. mean:

In both successful and failed campaigns, the median is a more reliable measure than the mean. The median provides a better representation of the typical number of backers, as it is less affected by outliers or campaigns with exceptionally high numbers of backers. For successful campaigns, the mean may be inflated by a few super popular campaigns, making the median a better indicator of what most campaigns achieve. The same principle applies to failed campaigns, where the median offers a more typical number of backers, unaffected by a small number of unusual cases. Median is a practical choice for understanding how most campaigns perform.

In terms of variance and standard deviation:

For successful campaigns, the higher variance and standard deviation suggest a wider range of performance due to the influence of a few exceptionally successful campaigns. In contrast, failed campaigns exhibit lower variance and standard deviation, indicating a more concentrated distribution of backers. These statistics provide insights into the variability and distribution of crowdfunding campaign performance.
